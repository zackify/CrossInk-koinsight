## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New **Progress Bar Specificity** status bar setting to round the book progress percentage to a whole number (default), one decimal (e.g. `12.1%`), or two decimals (e.g. `12.12%`).

## [v1.4.0.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Updates to support Xteink device detection so the correct display panel driver is used.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Dashboard UI theme for the Home screen, showing the current book cover and reading stats.
- Nearby Position Sync for sending or applying the current EPUB position between two CrossInk devices over ESP-NOW.
- Web EPUB optimizer support for CrossInk location metadata, so optimized EPUBs can keep better progress and stable page numbers.
- Reading Stats support for XTC and XTCH books, including reader menus, Home and sleep screen stats, mark finished, delete stats, and preserving stats when clearing book caches.
- Web file manager image previews, so PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, and WebP files can be viewed inline before downloading.

### Changed

- Home and sleep screens now load more cover and thumbnail data only when needed, reducing reader startup work and reusing cached cover data where possible.
- Built-in reader font choices have been reduced to Lexend Deca and Bitter, reducing firmware size while keeping fallback glyph coverage.

### Removed

- Teensy firmware builds are no longer produced for releases or release candidates.

### Fixed

- EPUB render-mode and Safe Mode toast messages now clear reliably, even when the reader is low on memory.
- EPUB Reading Stats no longer drops unsaved page-turn counts after viewing the stats screen mid-session.

- EPUB footnote previews no longer show clipped status-bar labels or misleading reader progress indicators, and clipping selection now works from footnote previews.
- Font selection no longer reopens the font preview after choosing a font.
- EPUB chapters with stale publisher style data now rebuild it instead of opening without the book's styling.
- Large SD-card font EPUBs no longer overlap characters after font or line-spacing changes, and clipping selection can fall back to a built-in UI font when needed.

- Nearby Position Sync now silently restarts back into the reader after using ESP-NOW, matching other WiFi sync flows and reducing post-sync memory fragmentation.
- EPUB page cache loading now uses fewer small heap allocations, reducing fragmentation-related reader failures.
- EPUB grayscale page turns on X3 now use the grayscale-aware display base, reducing the moment where new text appears too dark before the anti-aliased overlay finishes.
- EPUB chapters with many inline anchors, footnote links, malformed XHTML, large publisher styles, or SD-card fonts are less likely to fail or get stuck on the indexing screen.
- EPUB opening and image rendering now recover from more low-memory conditions instead of rebooting, including landscape image pages and books that need lighter render modes.
- EPUB clipping selection now follows right-to-left line order when selecting Hebrew and other RTL text.

- Optimized EPUBs now store location metadata at `META-INF/x-locations.json`.
- X3 SD-card writes now use the RTC for file timestamps when the clock is available.

### Changed

- The EPUB reader menu now splits the growing menu into 3 screens, labels per-book settings as `Book Options`, and avoids showing duplicate `Orientation` controls.

## [v1.3.3] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- `File Browser Display` in `Settings > System > Files & Cache` for choosing one-line or two-line file browser rows across all themes, while preserving Minimal users' existing two-line display on upgrade.
- `Hide File Extension` in `Settings > System > Files & Cache` for expanding file-browser filenames by hiding the right-side extension label.
- Device Name in Settings > System > Device for customizing the KOReader Sync and Nearby Stats Sync device label.

- Sleep Screen > Cover now generates the current book cover on demand instead of falling back to the dark sleep screen when the setting is changed after opening a book.
- File Browser now previews PNG images instead of trying to open them as EPUBs, and hides common macOS and Windows metadata files.
- File Browser now refreshes immediately after falling back to the root folder from a stale saved path.
- File Browser now stops loading oversized folders before low memory can crash the device and shows a memory error instead.

- SD-card font read failures no longer risk a reboot while cleaning up the failed file read.
- Page Overlay sleep screens no longer force EPUB chapters to re-index after waking.

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Current date in the top-right Settings header on X3 devices.
- Dark Reader Mode for EPUB and TXT reading screens, plus shortcut actions for the power button and front-button long press.
- File Browser long-press folder action for choosing a custom sleep-image folder instead of only `/.sleep` or `/sleep`.
- Expanded X3 Reading Stats, including streaks, time charts, editable dates, all-time backups, reset controls, an idle-time threshold, and the `Minimal Stats` sleep screen.
- `Reset Reading Pace` in the EPUB reader menu when Time Left is enabled, for clearing only the time-left pace estimate while keeping book reading stats.

### Changed

- Display, Reader, and Controls settings now open list menus instead of cycling through options one by one.
- Reading time and time-left pace tracking now ignore page intervals longer than the configured idle-time threshold.
- Web portal pages now use shared templates, stylesheet, and logo assets, reducing on-device page size and improving browser caching.
- Already-cached EPUBs now open directly to the first page without an extra book-loading popup refresh.
- Reader font-size choices now show point sizes like `10 pt` instead of names like `Tiny`.

### Fixed

- Home, Lyra Carousel, WiFi setup, and SD-card font flows now release memory more aggressively to avoid freezes or crashes on constrained builds.
- Vietnamese settings labels no longer show replacement diamonds after generated translation offsets shifted.
- KOReader Sync now lands correctly at chapter starts and shows more specific connection guidance.
- EPUB bookmarks saved under the old unstable path hash now show up again, including for books moved to `/Read`.
- SD-card font downloads now use versioned direct S3-hosted HTTP endpoints with CRC validation, avoiding GitHub release redirects and ESP32-C3 TLS stalls when loading the font catalog.
- EPUB text blocks now keep the book's alignment style when an inline image appears before the text.

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- EPUB reading-position improvements, including bookmark anchors, bookmark preview snippets, and optional chapter/book time-left estimates.
- Nearby Reading Stats sync with separate totals for this device and all synced CrossInk readers.
- Per-server OPDS filename settings so downloaded books can use either Author - Title or Title - Author.
- EPUB render heap diagnostics that include the largest allocatable block, not just total free heap.

### Changed

- Moved the X3 reader clock into a new top-centered status bar and moved clock settings to Settings > System > Device.

- Improved OPDS and font download responsiveness by reducing progress-update overhead and temporarily disabling WiFi power saving during transfers.
- Book selection now shows a loading popup before EPUB indexing or cache loading begins.
- Delayed the automatic finished-book prompt until the reader leaves the chapter where they reach 99%.

### Fixed

- WiFi settings screen now keeps the displayed MAC address consistent with the router-visible WiFi address.
- Reader UI issues with inverted menu button hints, Lyra Carousel popups, and Auto Page Turn interval persistence.
- Web uploads and KOReader Sync progress saves now preserve progress, stats, settings, and valid resume data for refreshed book files.
- OPDS low-memory handling now shows a specific parser-buffer memory message and releases SD-card fonts before catalog loading.
- EPUB cache, CSS, table, SD-card font, and allocation failure paths now recover, retry, or stop cleanly under low memory instead of opening unstyled pages, failing unnecessarily, or risking a reboot.
- EPUB text with invisible word-joiner characters no longer shows replacement diamonds for missing font glyphs.
- Clarified the low-memory EPUB image warning so it says some or all images may be missing.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Back/Cancel support while downloading books from OPDS catalogs.
- Recent Books long-press menu in both List and Grid views with delete, cache delete, completion, and remove-from-recents actions.

- In-reader confirmation message when a shortcut turns tilt-to-turn on or off.

### Fixed

- WiFi and OPDS connection-flow edge cases: manual Settings connections now show the connected status before continuing, copied or corrupted saved-password files are rejected before use, OPDS retries show loading before requests, and large OPDS feeds fail safely under low memory instead of rebooting.
- Reader and Home UI polish issues, including landscape status-bar settings, missing Vietnamese labels, File Browser and Lyra Carousel icon alignment, cover thumbnail artifacts, and duplicate Home progress/stat loading.
- EPUB cache and low-memory handling now use stable cache folder keys, migrate older cache folders where possible, rebuild stale section caches, lay out very long text blocks earlier, stream table fallback content when heap is tight, and clarify the warning text.
- Sleep-entry, network, and SD-card font download reliability improvements: cached sleep-screen assets are reused, OPDS pages idle normally after load, the X3 tilt sensor sleeps outside the reader, WiFi power saving is disabled during transfers, WebDAV stack usage is lower, longer stalls are tolerated, interrupted font files are retried, and active reader fonts are freed when needed.
- Remaining reader service edge cases, including an XTC chapter selector crash on memory-constrained builds, SD-card font size selection, SD-card font-size shortcuts skipping manually installed sizes, and KOReader Sync login compatibility with self-hosted servers that return valid JSON on success.

### Changed

- Modified upstream "page-as-sleep" behavior into a new `Sleep Screen > Quick Resume` option, which also keeps `Quick Resume on Timeout` on, and renamed the timeout-only toggle.
- Improved reader and browser menu behavior by moving the Footnotes shortcut above Select Chapter, wrapping long book titles in action menus, and reducing progress-screen repaint work during OPDS and SD font downloads.

## [v1.2.11.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Removed Medium font size from `xlarge` build to get it below the size limit

### Fixed

- Lyra Carousel is now included by activating the build flag `DCROSSINK_ENABLE_LYRA_CAROUSEL=1`

---

## [v1.2.11] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- New personal theme: "Minimal"
- Custom sleep timer picker so `Time to Sleep` can be set from 1 to 30 minutes instead of cycling fixed presets.
- In-reader Controls shortcut for customizing buttons without leaving the book.
- Bookmark cleanup shortcuts: hold Select on a bookmark to delete it, or hold Open on a book in Bookmarks to clear that book's bookmark list.
- Confirmation message after deleting a book's cache from the reader or File Browser.
- File Browser long-press action for deleting an EPUB or XTC book's cache.
- Downloaded-font size range setting so SD-card fonts can use compact, default, or large point-size sets.
- File Browser long-press action for marking EPUB books as finished or unfinished.

### Changed

- Hardened deep sleep entry by shutting WiFi down before waiting for the power button to be released.
- Raised the web file-transfer filename limit from 100 to 150 bytes so longer uploaded filenames are preserved.
- Made the in-reader Reader Options menu include the same Reader settings and actions as Settings > Reader.
- Split SD-card font descriptions and supported languages into separate lines in the font download screen.

### Fixed

- Inline EPUB images no longer disappear in landscape when their bottom edge slightly overlaps the screen margin.
- Reduced unnecessary low-memory image suppression for JPEG-heavy EPUB chapters and added CSS heap diagnostics during chapter rebuilds.
- Allowed wider inline JPEG images in EPUBs to render when they still fit the total pixel and heap safety limits.
- SD-card font picker no longer reopens immediately after selecting a font from Settings > Reader > Font Family.
- In-reader font-size changes now work for SD-card fonts.
- In-reader SD-card font changes now rebuild the current EPUB page layout consistently.

## [v1.2.10] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- `Recent Books View` setting so the dedicated Recent Books screen can switch between the classic list and a 3x3 cover grid.
- More flexible reader controls, including orientation-aware front/side button settings, nav-only or all-button front inversion, tilt page turn shortcuts, and side-button long-press rotation actions.
- Per-session auto page turn interval picker with values from 5 to 120 seconds.
- File Browser Home/Back long-press action for toggling hidden files and folders.
- EPUB rendering and diagnostics improvements, including visible `<hr>` separators and heap logs around section rebuilds, image extraction, page serialization, and sleep-cache rebuilds.
- Reader font coverage for block redactions, black-square ornaments, Greek category letters, and turned-comma punctuation (PR #104).
- Simulator tools for testing sleep/wake behavior and smoke-testing common screens and EPUB reader menus.

### Changed

- Reduced Controls settings section spacing so the grouped controls fit better on X3 screens.
- Made front reader long-press actions trigger when the hold delay is reached while normal page turns still trigger on release.
- Used the fast EPUB spine/TOC indexing path for books with 300+ spine entries so heavily split books build `book.bin` faster on first open.
- Allowed the web file manager and WebDAV to browse dot-prefixed hidden files when hidden files are enabled, matching the device file browser.

### Fixed

- Reader button and shortcut behavior, including X3 power-button wake filtering, folder delete long-press timing, and WiFi scan/connect screens that could not be exited while work was in progress.
- RoundedRaff home-menu, keyboard, and button-hint rendering issues so Settings remains reachable and compact labels no longer overlap or disappear.
- Font and glyph handling now reduces persistent SD-card font advance-cache memory, releases optional font caches before image extraction only when heap is tight, and shows a visible replacement symbol when compact UI fonts lack `U+FFFD`.
- KOReader Sync authentication diagnostics and an in-reader sync crash, including clearer handling when a server or proxy returns non-JSON content.
- EPUB text rendering for redactions, whitespace-only XHTML text nodes, simple black CSS span backgrounds, list bullets in `<li><p>...</p></li>` items, and very long base64-like text runs.
- EPUB image, thumbnail, and section-rebuild stability so image-heavy chapters use less temporary memory, scale images more reliably, avoid stale dimensions, and suppress optional image work earlier under heap pressure.
- EPUB low-memory and cache safety now skips optional next-chapter indexing and sleep-page cache rebuilds when heap is tight, fails safely with a malformed-book warning and Home exit path, rebuilds incompatible fork-written caches, and handles low-memory CSS parsing, truncated SD writes, invalid serialized strings, and failed temp-cache promotion.
- Home no longer crashes after clearing reading cache when the source EPUB cache is missing.
- Reader prewarm behavior now skips image decoding, keeps mixed-style font glyphs cached together, and avoids section rebuilds for render-quality-only option changes.
- Concurrent render/storage crashes are avoided by serializing `GfxRenderer` scratch-buffer access, shared SPI bus access, and failed SPI lock cleanup.
- Recent Books, EPUB/XTC thumbnail caches, deleted-folder metadata, and XTC cover scaling now keep cached book data in sync and grid covers fill their slots correctly.
- Simulator build configuration now lets SDL2 and simulator-provided network/OTA shims compile cleanly.

---

## [v1.2.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Cleaned up EPUB table rendering by removing synthetic row/cell labels and defaulting table cells to readable left alignment
- Allow simple EPUB tables with full-width note rows so a single `colspan` cell spanning the whole table no longer forces the entire table back to paragraph fallback

### Fixed

- Power-button shortcut conflicts outside the reader so reader-only actions fall back to `Confirm` while Sleep, Refresh, Screenshot, Sync Progress, and File Transfer remain real power actions.
- Potential crash when using `Go to %` in EPUBs.
- Potential crash when entering sleep with Page Overlay enabled if the cached EPUB page data is invalid.
